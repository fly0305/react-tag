### Contributing

1. Have an idea to change the API - add new props, classnames, etc? Please raise an issue and discuss it before you start implementing it.
2. Want to submit a new pull request (PR)? Great! Make sure you add tests (or give an explanation why you won't be adding any). Try to get feedback early and often!
3. This project uses [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) to enforce a JS styleguide. Make sure you run `npm run format` before sending a PR.
4. **DO NOT** commit any code in the `dist` and `dist-modules` directory. Code in these files is auto-generated and is on released on Github for easy distribution. Once your PR is merged, one of the owners will release a build with your changes alongside publishing your change on NPM.
