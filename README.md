### React-Tags

React tags is a simple tagging component ready to drop in your React projects. The component is inspired by GMail's *To* field in the compose window. 

### Features
- Autocomplete based on a suggestion list
- Keyboard friendly and mouse support
- Reorder tags using drag and drop

### Why
Because I was looking for an excuse to build a standalone component and publish it in the wild? To be honest, I needed a tagging component that provided the above features for my [React-Surveyman](http://github.com/prakhar1989/react-surveyman) project. Since I was unable to find one which met my requirements (and the fact that I generally enjoy re-inventing the wheel) this is what I came up with.


### Demo

Check it out [here](http://prakhar.me/react-tags/example)

### Installation
The preferred way of using the component is via NPM

```
npm install --save react-tag-input
```
It is, however, also available to be used separately (`dist/ReactTags.min.js`). If you prefer this method remember to include [ReactDND](https://github.com/gaearon/react-dnd) as a dependancy. Refer to the [demo](http://prakhar.me/react-tags/example) to see how this works.

### Usage

Here's a sample implementation that initializes the component with a list of initial `tags` and `suggestions` list. Apart from this, there are multiple events, handlers for which need to be set. For more details, go through the [API](#Options).

```javascript
var ReactTags = require('react-tags');

var App = React.createClass({
    getInitialState: function() {
        return {
            tags: [ {id: 1, text: "Apples"} ],
            suggestions: ["Banana", "Mango", "Pear", "Apricot"];
        }
    },
    handleDelete: function(i) {
        var tags = this.state.tags;
        tags.splice(i, 1);
        this.setState({tags: tags});
    },
    handleAddition: function(tag) {
        var tags = this.state.tags;
        tags.push({
            id: tags.length + 1,
            text: tag
        });
    },
    handleDrag: function(tag, currPos, newPos) {
        var tags = this.state.tags;

        // mutate array
        tags.splice(currPos, 1);
        tags.splice(newPos, 0, tag);

        // re-render
        this.setState({ tags: tags });
    },
    render: function() {
        var tags = this.state.tags;
        var suggestions = this.state.suggestions;
        return (
            <div>
                <ReactTags tags={tags} 
                    suggestions={Countries}
                    handleDelete={this.handleDelete}
                    handleAddition={this.handleAddition}
                    handleDrag={this.handleDrag} />
            </div>
        )
    }
});

React.render(<App />, document.getElementById('app'));
```

### Options

- [`tags`](#tagsOption)
- [`suggestions`](#suggestionsOption)
- [`handleAddition`](#handleAdditionOption)
- [`handleDelete`](#handleDeleteOption)
- [`handleDrag`](#handleDragOption)

<a name="tagsOption"></a>
##### tags (optional)
An array of tags that are displayed as pre-selected. Each tag should have an `id` and a `text` property which is used to display.

```js
var tags =  [ {id: 1, text: "Apples"} ]
```

<a name="suggestionsOption"></a>
##### suggestions (optional)
An array of suggestions that are used as basis for showing suggestions. At the moment, this should be an array of strings. 

```js
var suggestions = ["mango", "pineapple", "orange", "pear"];
```


### Thanks
The autocomplete dropdown is inspired by Lea Verou's [awesomeplete](https://github.com/LeaVerou/awesomplete) library. The Drag and drop functionality is provided by Dan Abramov's insanely useful [ReactDND](https://github.com/gaearon/react-dnd) library.
